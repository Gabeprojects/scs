       <h2> <p>Were Stephine
This year, 2015, marks the 67th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948–2015). This declaration affirms that all human beings have the right to freedom from want and freedom from fear. These human rights are inclusive, interdependent and universal.</p>
<p>
Whether we are concerned with suffering born of poverty, with denial of freedom, with armed conflict, or with a reckless attitude to the natural environment everywhere, we should not view these events in isolation. Eventually their repercussions are felt by all of us. We, therefore, need effective international action to address these global issues from the perspective of the oneness of humanity, and from a profound understanding of the deeply interconnected nature of today's world.
</p>
<p>
At birth, all human beings are naturally endowed with the qualities we need for our survival, such as caring, nurturing and loving kindness. However, despite already possessing such positive qualities, we tend to neglect them. As a result, humanity faces unnecessary problems. What we need to do is to make more effort to sustain and develop these qualities. Therefore, the promotion of human values is of primary importance. We also need to focus on cultivating good human relations, for, regardless of differences in nationality, religious faith, race, or whether people are rich or poor, educated or not, we are all human beings. When we are facing difficulties, we invariably meet someone, who may be a stranger, who immediately offers us help.</p>
 We all depend on each other in difficult circumstances, and we do so unconditionally. We do not ask who people are before we offer them help. We help because they are human beings like us.
 </p>
 <p>
When we rise in the morning and listen to the radio or read the newspaper, we are confronted with the same sad news: violence, crime, wars, and disasters. I cannot recall a single day without a report of something terrible happening somewhere. Even in these modern times it is clear that one's precious life is not safe. No former generation has had to experience so much bad news as we face today; this constant awareness of fear and tension should make any sensitive and compassionate person question seriously the progress of our modern world.
<p>
In view of the above, there is and there will always be a greater need to develop International capacities of leaders from all communities for purposes of propagating Peace and Reconciliation initiatives among the people, if a lasting peace, security and development are to be sustained.
Juhudi Urban Arts is an international Non Profit community based Organization that was registered in April 2012. We are a non-profit social circus organization that uses circus arts to motivate social change. By inspiring individuals and connecting communities with our circus education and entertainment programs, we have a positive impact on the Nairobi and watamu, Mombasa area and beyond.</p>
<p>
our programs teach valuable life skills like perseverance, focus, and teamwork. Learning circus with others teaches trust, responsibility and cooperation. The most important experience we give our participants is the opportunity to meet and interact with children from different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds than their own.
</p>
We believe the path to peace is a path of cooperation and communication. Teaching children from different neighborhoods how to Flip, fly and juggle is the best way through this path. it’s the technique we use! Juhudi Urban Arts promotes peace though pyramids and Artistic work.
<p>
Juhudi Urban Arts is implementing a five-year working and training strategy that will collectively change the lives of millions of underprivileged children around Kenya and East and Central Africa.
</p>
These action plans, which will be rolled out in phases with the collaborative efforts of over 25 social circus organizations across the World, comprise of the following projects
<ul>

<li>> International youth arts festivals
<li>> National youth arts festivals
<li>> Capacity building workshops for local and international youth
<li>> Vocational educational trainings for circus artists and the community
<p>
Its main aim is to build leadership capacities for development amongst stakeholders in Civil Society Organizations [CSOs]-faith groups, women groups, co-operative societies etc. the Organization is seeking support to build leadership for peace and reconciliation as a strategy for healing process and world peace.
</p>
<p>
Juhudi Urban Arts proudly officially announce our world charity tour starting in Europe, USA, Australia and thanks for the help and support of the Agency of the International Development USAID, AUSAID, UNICEF for promoting peace in the World.
</p>
<p>
Juhudi Urban Arts will present Teeter Board act as part of our world tour thanks to Russian State Circus in coordination with Mambo Kenya Acrobats for the generous training programme in Russia.
